<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
CapabilityStatement2 is a draft of a new approach to CapabilityStatement. It
leaves all the normative structure of CapabilityStatement in place, and replaces 
the trial use features with a terminology based approach which makes for simpler
conversations between systems around what features of the specification and/or 
implementation guides that a system supports, or that it needs it's partner 
systems to support.
